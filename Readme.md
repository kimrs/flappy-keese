This is a short project I did to test out TypeScript. The Idea was to make a Flappy Birds kind of game where the 
path ahead was constructed by random bezier curves. I stopped further development once I decided that the game mechanic would not be addictive enough. This was my second attempt at trying to create a fun and innovative game mechanic using bezier curves. The frist one can be found [here](https://github.com/kimrs/racing-game)
